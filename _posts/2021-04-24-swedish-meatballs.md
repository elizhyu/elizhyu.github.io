- Parchment Paper
- Measuring Tool (for half ounce)

**Procedures:**

- In a large bowl, mix ground beef, ground pork, onion, garlic, bread crumbs, eggs, milk, salt, pepper and one tablespoon of oil. (Mix just enough to combine and try not to overmix.)

- Use any measuring tool to get half-ounce meatballs, and line up on a sheet tray covered in parchment.

- Refrigerate the meatballs on the sheet tray for one hour to set.

- Preheat oven to 350°F.

- Heat a skillet over medium heat with one tablespoon of olive oil, and once hot gently place the meatballs in the pan and cook on all sides for about 4-5 minutes. (Use a small spatula or tongs to continually turn the meatballs to brown evenly. Remove these browned meatballs to the prepared sheet pan.)

- Once all the meatballs have been browned and are now lined up on the sheet tray, place the sheet tray in the oven and cook for 15 minutes.

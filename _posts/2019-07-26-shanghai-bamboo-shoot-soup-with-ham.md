Yāndǔxiān (腌笃鲜) is a Jiangnan cuisine made from a duo of cured pork and fresh pork with fresh winter bamboo shoots.

Many Chinese dishes have names adopted from folklore. "Yān" means salted pork, and "dǔ" represents the sound of the boiling soup, and "xiān" describe the delicate flavor of the soup. Yāndǔxiān is one of the typical local cuisine.

A traditional coffee + milk latte variation with strong and creamy coconut flavor, both tasty and good-looking.

---

**Ingredients:**

- Coconut Milk / Coconut Water + Milk (1:1)
- Espresso Shot(s)

---

**Procedures:**

- Use a transparent/clear glass cup if possible to show the good look. Chill the glass or add some ice to help with the separation look.

- Add in the cold coconut milk or the 1:1 mixture of coconut water and milk. (The quantity should be the same as the milk used in normal coffee latte.)

- Pour in the espresso shot(s) over a spoon into the cup to reduce the impact so that the liquid separation would be better.

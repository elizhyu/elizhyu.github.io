  Caffeine, as the common ground of the brewed coffee and tea as well as modern drinks like soda and energy drink, definitely "kill" your tiredness, but it also might sometimes give you too much "awakeness" when you indeed want to take a rest.

        <h3>If you drink for AWAKING EFFECT</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left;text-indent: 2em;">
            You might only need to know the positive side of caffeine.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left;text-indent: 2em;">
            Caffeine's effect on people body can be traced back to our central nervous system where our nerve cells regularly interact with different chemicals, or molecules, in our body to help us think, feel, and sense our world.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">
          <b>The molecule that manages "tiredness"</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left;text-indent: 2em;">
          Each day, your body produces a chemical called adenosine (ah-den-o-seen). It can slow down activity in the brain and is part of what makes us sleepy. The chemical helps send a signal to the body when we need sleep, which helps the body recharge.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left;text-indent: 2em;">
          Part of the reason you feel tired is because the adenosine molecules you made have actually reached parts of your nerve cells called receptors. A receptor is kind of like a keyhole. The adenosine is kind of like a key and it can unlock your sleepiness. But sometimes an imposter molecule comes along.

          <b>Tricking the brain and body</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left;text-indent: 2em;">
          To your neurons, the caffeine molecule looks a lot like the adenosine molecule. The reason we donâ€™t feel tired when we have caffeine is because caffeine literally blocks the adenosine from reaching our cells and doing the job of making us sleepy. Caffeine thus gives us a temporary feeling of being awake.

        <h3>If you drink for TASTE and AROMA</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left;text-indent: 2em;">
          You might sometimes don't want the influence of caffeine, hence care and worrying about the amount of caffeine within your drink.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left;text-indent: 2em;">
          The "typical amount" safe for most healthy adult is up to 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, which is roughly the amount of caffeine in four cups of brewed coffee, 10 cans of cola or 2 cans of energy drink.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left;text-indent: 2em;">
          But all those estimation above are only for average people. For us, who are hunting for enjoyable taste and fascinating aroma, we are going for a variety of coffee beans and tea leaves, as well as a wide range of processing and brewing methods, resulting in great difference at that final liquid into our mouse.

        <p style="text-align:left;text-indent: 2em;">
          Though still varies depending on brands and products, the numbers below gives you a brief idea of the amount of caffeine you take in your pleasant drink.

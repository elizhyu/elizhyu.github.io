    <h4>Music Taste</h4>
    <p>
        I'm a music enthusiast enjoying mainly <b>POP</b> and <b>ROCK</b> music (including <i>J-pop</i> and <i>K-pop</i>). 
        My favourite ones are those combining the <i>national/cultural</i> <i>traditional/retro</i> music style with international pop style, 
        like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagakki_Band" target="_blank">Wagakki Band (和楽器バンド)</a> 
        that uses Japanese traditional musical instruments in <i>pop/rock</i> music.

    <h4>Musician Me</h4>
    <p>
        Besides enjoying music, I'm also a hobbyist drummer/bass guitarist. I both play at home for fun and at worship in Church.

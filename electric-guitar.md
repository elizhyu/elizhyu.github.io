The electric guitar born in the [Engineering Technology Acoustics Lab](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/facilities/acoustics-lab) at Purdue University during a **String Instrument Fabrication** course of the [National STEM Guitar Project](http://guitarbuilding.website/) instructed by [Dr. Mark French](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~rmfrench/index.htm).

        The final finshed guitar made of 4 main pieces:
        <ul>
            <li>Neck</li>
            <li>Nut</li>
            <li>Fretboard</li>
            <li>Body</li>
        </ul>

## Design Stage

        The picture shows a sketch of the guitar's earliest design, of which the idea comes from <i>Romulan Warbird</i>, the alien star ship appeared in Star Trek Franchise. (Mostly the top crossview of it.)

        <i>(BTW, Star Trek is my favourite Sci-Fi Franchise.)</i>

    <div style="flex:60%;">
        As the design concept of the guitar had been decided, we made lots of calculations to find the correct dimensions and sizes of functional guitar parts so that it can eventually work. As shwon in the picture below, important dimensions like neck scale length and bridge position were calculated according to formulas. Also, body thickness was decided according to the actual thickness of the wood plank we had.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        After that, we used lasercut cardboards to make prototypes of our design to have a more straightforward idea of it for us to optimize. Through several iterations, as one of it shown on the right, we had our final shape and dimensions decided.
